## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this second project of Udacity Self Driving Car nanodegree program, we use what we've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we then try out our model on images of German traffic signs that we have collected on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Repository content
---
Repository contains three files:
 
* the Ipython notebook with the code (Traffic\_Sign_Classifier.py)
* An HTML export of the notebook (report.html)
* a writeup report (markdown)

and a directory with figures.

Dependencies
---
This lab requires the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
